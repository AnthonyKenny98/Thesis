# Anthony Kenny Thesis

This thesis aims to design RISC-V computer architecture that supports the fast execution of motion planning algorithms for drone applications. First, the computation of sampling-based motion planning algorithms commonly used in autonomous drones (such as RRT, RRT*, PRM) will be profiled on an unmodified RISC-V processor. From this profiling, common bottlenecks and hotspots in execution will be identified. Based on these results, this project will extend the RISC-V ISA and design a modified processor to support the extensions.
