\definenewglossaryterm{GPU}{Graphics Processing Unit}{Similar to a \gls{CPU}, a high-powered circuit designed for highly parallelized computation of images for a display device. Their highly parallel nature mean they can be utilised for other, non-graphics related, computations}

\definenewglossaryterm{HDL}{Hardware Description Language}{A computer language used for designing computer hardware. It is used to define the behaviour of modules, simulate their performance, and synthesize them on a \gls{FPGA}}

\definenewglossaryterm{HLS}{High Level Synthesis}{An automated hardware design process that takes software written in high-level languages (often C, C++) that algorithmically defines a function, and converts that into \gls{HDL} that implements that function}

\definenewglossaryterm{ISA}{Instruction Set Architecture}{An abstract model of a computer, that defines the instructions, registers, memory behaviour, and other attributes of a computer architecture. It can be thought of as the contract between software and hardware developers, as the ISA lists the instructions that software may be implemented in, and the instructions that a processor must support}

\definenewglossaryterm{OGM}{Occupancy Grid Map}{A method of representing a \gls{2D} or \gls{3D} space by dividing it into discrete ``grids'' and marking each whole grid as ``occupied'', even if only part of it is}

\definenewglossaryterm{PRM}{Probabalistic Road Map}{A motion planning algorithm that randomly samples free space, and then connects sampled configurations with nearby configurations to build a map}

\definenewglossaryterm{RISC}{Reduced Instruction Set Computer}{A computer architecture based on a small number of instructions executed in a small number of cycles}

\definenewglossaryterm{RRT}{Rapidly-exploring Random Tree}{An algorithm designed to efficiently search, and thus plan a path through, a high-complexity environment by randomly sampling points and building a tree. The algorithm randomly samples points, draws an edge from the nearest currently existing node in the tree, to grow the tree in the space}

\definenewglossaryterm{RRT*}{Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star}{A motion planning algorithm that builds on \gls{RRT} by computing lowest cost edges, resulting in straighter paths}

\definenewglossaryterm{RV32I}{RISC-V 32-Bit Integer}{One of the four base ISAs within RISC-V. While it implements integer values only in 32-bit representations, it contains the minimal number of instructions for a fully working computer processor}

\definenewglossaryterm{}{automata}{moving mechanical devices made in imitation of human beings}

\definenewglossaryterm{}{real-time}{Describes a system in which input data is processed in such a time period such that it is available almost immediately. Systems such as missle guidance or collision avoidance in cars are an example of real-time systems}

\definenewglossaryterm{}{tethered robot}{Refers to robots that are limited by a cable connection for power, data transfer, communication, or control}

\definenewglossaryterm{}{configuration}{A specification of a robot's location, position, and setting in a space. For example, when a robot is represented by a single point in 3D space, its configuration is merely x, y, and z coordinates. But if a robot is represented as a 3D humanoid with a head, body, arms and legs, then its configuration would be its position in 3D space, its orientation in 3D, and the position of all its joints and limbs such that the space being taken up by the robot can be exactly determined. Consequently, as the physical complexity of a robot increases, so too does the complexity of representing it algorithmically}
