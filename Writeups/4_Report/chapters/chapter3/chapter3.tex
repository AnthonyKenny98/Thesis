\section{HoneyBee}
    The Honey Bee has long been renowned for its tireless work ethic. But people rarely give the Honey Bee credit for its remarkable navigation and collision avoidance strategies during flight. As such, it is quite appropriate that this functional unit, designed to work tirelessly, rapidly and efficiently to execute collision detection computations, is named HoneyBee.

    \subsection{Design}
        It was demonstrated in Section \ref{section:rrt_analysis_results} that the critical function of \ac{RRT} was edge collision detection.
