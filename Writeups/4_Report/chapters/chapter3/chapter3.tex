The second objective of this thesis was to design and implement a functional hardware unit that accelerates the execution of \gls{RRT} in \gls{3D}. With the bottleneck function having been identified in Chapter 2 as edge collision detection, Chapter 3 details the specification, design, implementation, and analysis of a hardware unit the implements the edge collision function.
