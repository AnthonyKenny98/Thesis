% TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
\subsection{Technical Specifications}

    With \gls{RRT} selected as the benchmark algorithm against which to test specialized hardware, this project required an implementation of the algorithm that satisfied the following criteria shown in Table \ref{table:RRT_Tech_Specs_Abbrev}. Appendix \ref{section:rrt_appendix_tech_specs} is a more thorough description of the technical specifications for the implementation of RRT. 

    % Tech Spec Table
    \input{chapters/chapter2/tables/rrt_tech_specs}

    The original intention was to find an existing implementation of RRT that could fulfill these requirements. However, no open-source implementations were suitable. Appendix \ref{section:rrt_appendix_existing_implementations} shows an evaluation of existing implementations.

    As a result, it was necessary to build a C implementation of RRT from the ground up to the aformentioned specifications.

% IMPLEMENTATION DESIGN
\subsection{Implementation Design}
    The design and implementation of \gls{RRT}, while neccessary, was significant and time consuming. Since this was not the main object of this thesis, only a brief description of key design choices has been included here. Appendix \ref{appendix:rrt_appendix} contains a more detailed account.

    \subsubsection{Parameterization}
        Table \ref{table:rrt_params} shows the parameters that were included in the implementation and compiled by way of a C header file.
        \input{chapters/chapter2/tables/params.tex}

    \subsubsection{Dimensionality}
        \gls{RRT} was implemented in both \gls{2D} and \gls{3D}. Not only did a \gls{2D} implementation provide a good development checkpoint, it was also interesting to see the difference in computational load between \gls{2D} and \gls{3D}, shown in Section \ref{section:rrt_analysis}.

    \subsubsection{Modelling a \gls{UAV}}
        The \gls{UAV} was modelled as a \gls{3D} rectangular prism, with its configuration represented by Cartesian coordinates $(x,y,z)$ and Euler angles $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$.

    \subsubsection{Key Functions}
        Algorithm \ref{algorithm:rrt_collision} shows that there are 5 key functions that constitute \gls{RRT}. Figure \ref{fig:rrt_functions} demonstrates each of these functions: \texttt{getRandomConfig()}, \texttt{findNearestConfig()}, \\
        \texttt{stepFromNearest()}, \texttt{configCollisions()}, and \texttt{edgeCollisions()}. Appendix \ref{section:rrt_appendix_function_impl} shows in detail how each of these functions was implemented.

% VISUALIZING IMPLEMENTATION
\newpage
\subsection{Implementation Visualization}
    With the back end functionality of \gls{RRT} designed and implemented, it was neccesary to develop a way to visualize it. Many existing implementations had the visualization interface run synchonously alongside \gls{RRT}. This would distort any performance analysis results, and so in this implementation it was left until after \gls{RRT} had finished executing and then plotted using Python.

    \subsubsection{Plotting Configurations and the Workspace}
        Plotting the workspace using the ``matplotlib'' library was relatively simple in both \gls{2D} and \gls{3D}, shown in Figure \ref{fig:rrt_workspace}. It was decided that the \gls{UAV}'s' configuration would be visualized only as its origin point, rather than plotting a \gls{3D} rectangular prism at each configuration, in order to maintain simplicity. Nevertheless, the \gls{UAV} was still modelled as a 3D prism in the backend. \textbf{Note:} The 2D space and 3D space have different start and end points and different \glspl{OGM} to better demonstrate how \gls{RRT} functions.

    \subsubsection{Plotting Obstacles}
        Obstacles were plotted in accordance to the input \gls{OGM}, shown in Figure \ref{fig:rrt_obstacles}

    \subsubsection{Plotting RRT Graph}
        To keep the plot simple, it was decided to not show the origin point of each configuration in the graph produced by \gls{RRT}. Instead, only the edges of the graph were plotted, seen in Figure \ref{fig:rrt_full}
