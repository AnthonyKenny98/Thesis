% TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS
\subsection{Technical Specifications}

    With \gls{RRT} selected as the benchmark algorithm against which to test specialised hardware, this project required an implementation of the algorithm that satisfied the following criteria shown in Table \ref{table:RRT_Tech_Specs_Abbrev}. Appendix \ref{section:rrt_appendix_tech_specs} is a more thorough description of the technical specifications for the implementation of RRT.

    The original intention was to find an existing implementation of RRT that could fulfill these requirements. However, no open-source implementations were suitable. Appendix \ref{section:rrt_appendix_existing_implementations} shows an evaluation of existing implementations.

    As a result, it was necessary to build a C implementation of RRT from the ground up to the aformentioned specifications.

\subsection{Implementation Design}
    
    The design and implementation of \gls{RRT}, while neccessary, was significant and time consuming. Since this was not the main object of this thesis, only a brief description of key design choices has been included here. Appendix \ref{appendix:rrt_appendix} contains a more detailed account.

    \subsubsection{Parameterization}
        Table \ref{table:rrt_params} shows the parameters that were included in the implementation and compiled by way of a C header file.

    \subsubsection{Key Functions}
        Algorithm \ref{algorithm:rrt_collision} shows that there are 5 key functions that constitute \gls{RRT}. Figure \ref{fig:rrt_functions} demonstrates each of these functions: \texttt{getRandomConfig()}, \texttt{findNearestConfig()}, \texttt{stepFromNearest()}, \texttt{(configCollisions)}, and \texttt{edgeCollisions()}.
