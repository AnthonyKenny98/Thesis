\subsection{Methodology}
    To restate, the aim of this thesis is to design a computer processor with reduced execution time of motion planning algorithms, such as \ac{RRT}. As such, it is important to understand the elements of the algorithm that have the highest percentage of CPU execution time. To determine this, it was necessary to implement my own, naive but typical, \ac{RRT} in C. This program could then be compiled and analysed using a software performance profiling tool. With this, I could design experiments to determine the critical RRT functions (those occupying a majority of CPU time) and see how this varies given different parameters.

    \subsubsection{VTune Amplifier Analysis}
    \label{subsubsection:vtune}
        VTune Amplifier performance profiler is an application for software performance analysis. It provides functionality to examine hot-spots for CPU execution time through a top down analysis, shown below in Figure \ref{figure:VTuneTopDown}. As can be seen from the figure, the top down analysis tool shows the percentage of CPU time taken up by each function. I used this tool to profile the algorithm's performance as I changed certain parameters.
