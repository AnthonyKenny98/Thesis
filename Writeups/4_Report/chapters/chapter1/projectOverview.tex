\subsection{Proposed Solution}
    This thesis proposes a non-standard RISC-V Instruction Set Extension, supported by a functional unit embedded in a \ac{FPGA} synthesizable processor design that more rapidly computes motion planning for autonomous \ac{UAV}s. It will use the \ac{RRT} algorithm as a benchmark for performance analysis. Profiling of \ac{RRT} described in chapter \ref{chap:MotionPlanningInSoftware} found that edge collision detection was the most performance limiting function of \ac{RRT}. As such, this thesis aims to design a RISC-V extension and specific circuitry that support the faster execution of edge collision detection.

    \subsubsection*{System Overview}
        Figure \ref{fig:systemDiagram} shows a high level overview of the system this thesis proposes.
        \input{chapters/chapter1/figures/systemDiagram.tex}
        The \textbf{Extended RISC-V \ac{ISA}} is made up of the \ac{RV32I} Base Instruction Set and a \ifdraft{\color{red}\textbf{currently unnamed}\color{black}} non-standard extension that this thesis will define.
        The \textbf{PhilosophyV Processor} is a RISC-V chip built in \ac{HDL} for this thesis. It implements both the \ac{RV32I} instruction set and the non-standard extension.
        The PhilosphyV Core includes, along with a baseline 5-stage processor implementation, the \textbf{HoneyBee} collision detection unit.
        A \textbf{C Implementation of RRT} is loaded into the instruction memory of the PhilosophyV processor. This processor, synthesized on an \textbf{\ac{FPGA}}, is used as the main processor, co-processor, or accelerator on an \textbf{Autonomous \ac{UAV}}. Table \ref{table:componentList} outlines the components of this system and their descriptions.
