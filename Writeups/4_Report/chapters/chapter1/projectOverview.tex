\subsection{Project Goals}
This is not the first project to attempt to accelerate motion planning algorithms using hardware; motion planning optimization has been studied extensively in hardware and in software. But the problem persists that, due to the nature of conventional \glspl{ISA}, there are significant barriers to implementing motion planning specific processors. \\

RISC-V was released 9 years ago. While it is starting to gain some traction in the commercial space, RISC-V has not yet been used to develop a motion planning specific processor. As such, the overall mission of this thesis is as follows:

        To present a proof-of-concept for extending and implementing RISC-V to develop motion planning specific processors.
    \end{center}
    }
} \\
\end{center}

\noindent To achieve this, the following 4 objectives must be accomplished:

        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Determine the computational bottleneck of a commonly used motion planning algorithm.
            \item Implement a functional hardware module to replace the bottleneck function.
            \item Define a motion planning extension to the RISC-V ISA 
            \item Build a fully functional motion-planning processor that implements the extended RISC-V ISA
        \end{enumerate}
    }
} \\

    \subsubsection{Computer Implementation Hierarchy}
        To briefly frame the space in which this thesis operates, consider the hierarchy of computer implementation, demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:computerHierarchy}. \textbf{User level applications}, such as Microsoft Word, Google Chrome, and Apple's iTunes, sit at the top of the hierarchy. These applications are implemented in \textbf{High/Mid Level Languages}, such as C/, C++, Python, Java, etc. 
        This software is eventually executed on a \textbf{Processor}, otherwise known as a \gls{CPU}. A processor does not understand Python, or any other programming language for that matter. The only thing it can understand is binary values (a one or a zero). Every computer program gets translated into ones and zeros (called machine code) for execution on a processor. But how are languages like C translated into machine code? The layer between programming languages and the processor is the \textbf{Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)}. Chapter 4 goes into detail about \gls{ISA}s and how they work. For now, if unfamiliar with the topic, it is sufficient to think of an \gls{ISA} as a translator between programming languages and machine code. This thesis operates across the lower three levels of this hierarchy.

\subsection{Project Structure}
\label{subsection:project_structure}

    Chapter 2 details how \glsfirst{RRT}, a commonly used motion planning algorithm, is implemented and analysed. From this analysis, it was determined that the computational bottleneck is edge collision detection. Chapter 3 outlines a process for implementing this bottleneck function in a hardware module, achieving a $5 \times$ speedup. Chapter 4 defines the RISC-V motion planning extension and describes the build of a RISC-V processor that implements this extension and the Honeybee unit.


    \subsubsection{System Overview}
        Figure \ref{fig:systemDiagram} shows a high level overview of the system this thesis proposes.

        Table \ref{table:componentList} on Page \pageref{table:componentList} outlines the components of this system and their descriptions.

    \subsubsection{Measure of Success}
        This thesis will be considered a success if it can present a compelling argument for the merits of designing motion planning specific processors \textbf{with the RISC-V ISA}. This will require:
        \begin{itemize}
        \item Demonstrating a clear performance limiting bottleneck function of motion planning algorithms.
        \item Achieving significant performance improvements by implementing the identified bottleneck function in hardware.
        \item Proving that a custom RISC-V extension can be easily defined and clearly reduces the complexity of executing the bottleneck function.
        \end{itemize}
