\section{PhilosophyV}
    \textit{Philosophy IV}, written in 1903 by Mr. Owen Wister of the Class of 1882, recounts the antics of two Harvard students and their last minute attempts to study (or avoid studying) for an exam for which they are hopelessly unprepared. Similarly, this section details the process of my attempt to build a RISC-V processor, by far the most complex part of this Thesis, and a task for which I am unsure of my preparedness. As such, this processor is named Philosphy V; both in reference to the RISC-V ISA for which it is designed, and to the fact that my current situation seems much like a sequel to Mr. Wister's novel.
