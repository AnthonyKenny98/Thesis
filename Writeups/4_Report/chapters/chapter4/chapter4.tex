% INTRO
To recap, the bottleneck function of a common motion planning algorithm, \gls{RRT}, was identified as edge collision detection. The functional hardware unit, HoneyBee, successfully accelerated this function by almost 5 times. The last two objectives of this thesis were:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item To define a RISC-V Extension Instruction Set for the purposes of accelerating motion planning.
    \item To verify the RISC-V Extension and the functional hardware unit in a complete RISC-V Processor.
    \end{itemize}
