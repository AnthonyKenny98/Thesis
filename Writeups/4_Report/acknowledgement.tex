% \begin{center}

To my faculty advisor, Prof. Vijay Janapa Reddi, thank you for your guidance and for inspiring my passion for computer architecture in my Junior year. \\ \\

To Jon Cruz, I couldn't have done this without you. Thank you for introducing me to the tools I needed, for your invaluable advice, and for always being available.  \\ \\

To Patrick Ulrich and the members of my ES100 section, I appreciated our weekly meetings and the fresh perspectives you offered.\\ \\

To Isabella Rhyu, thank you for your help with the more mathematically rigourous parts of this thesis, though I know you found them easy. \\ \\

To Mr. Trombetta, Jeffrey and Balmore. I thank you with heart and soul for providing a home to me for the past three weeks. I regret that our time together was cut short, but I look forward to coming up again soon - I'm sure it will be the same forever.   \\ \\
