\abstract{This thesis describes a process for accelerating motion planning in autonomous robots through the design of specialised microarchitecture and instruction set architecture. First, it shows the analysis of computational performance of \gls{RRT}, a sampling-based motion planning algorithm commonly used in autonomous drones. Having identified collision detection as the biggest area of opportunity for improved performance, it describes the process of designing specialized hardware, taking advantage of parallelization, that quickly detects collisions. Finally, it presents how this specialized functional unit can be implemented in a processor, and a RISC-V \gls{ISA} extension designed to massively reduce the execution time of collision detection.}
