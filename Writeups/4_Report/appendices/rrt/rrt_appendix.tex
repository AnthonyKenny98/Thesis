\section{Justification of Modelling UAV as Prism}
\label{section:rrt_appendix_modelling}
    While it is possible for a \gls{UAV} to be modelled in precise detail, taking into account its exact shape, more often \glspl{UAV} are modelled as a 3D prism in motion planning problems, for the following reasons:
    \begin{itemize}
    \item It is a rare case that the negative space gained by modelling in such detail is utilised
    \item Representation of drone's configuration is much more complex.
    \item Computing edge collisions is much more computationally intensive.
    \end{itemize}
