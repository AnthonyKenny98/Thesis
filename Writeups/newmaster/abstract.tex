\abstract{This thesis aims to design RISC-V computer architecture that supports the fast execution of motion planning algorithms for drone applications. First, the computation of sampling-based motion planning algorithms commonly used in autonomous drones (such as \ac{RRT}, \ac{RRT*}, \ac{PRM}) will be profiled on an unmodified RISC-V processor. From this profiling, common bottlenecks and hotspots in execution will be identified. Based on these results, this project will extend the RISC-V \ac{ISA} and design a modified processor to support the extensions.}
