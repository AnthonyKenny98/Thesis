\abstract{This thesis demonstrates the design of RISC-V computer architecture that supports faster execution of motion planning algorithms for drone applications. First, it shows the analysis of computational performance of \ac{RRT}, a sampling-based motion planning algorithm commonly used in autonomous drones. Having identified collision detection as the biggest area of opportunity for improved performance, it describes the process of designing specialized hardware, taking advantage of parallelization, that quickly detects collisions. Finally, it presents how this specialized functional unit can be implemented in a processor, and the RISC-V \ac{ISA} extended to invoke execution to massively reduce the execution time of collision detection.}
